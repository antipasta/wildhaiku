# wildhaiku

WildHaiku reads data off of a public stream of Tweets, outputting tweets that contain substrings that are haikus(5 syllables, 7 syllables, 5 syllables)

Running this requires a set of Twitter consumer and access keys. 

Some examples of found haikus during development of this project can be seen at https://twitter.com/awildhaiku
